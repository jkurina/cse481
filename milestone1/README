This directory contains team 2's code for milestone 1.

1) To start up the gui, run rqt. Our gui is called Squirtle Milestone 1.
2) To test out the navigation, run:
a) rosrun map_server map_server basement_map.yaml in a terminal window
b) realrobot && roslaunch pr2_navigation_global rviz_move_base.launch in another window
c) ssh to c1 and run roslaunch pr2_2dnav pr2_2dnav.launch in another window
Then, help the robot localize

All code (and maps) is in rqt_milestone1/src/rqt_milestone1
